PedeMath - A Python Vector and Math Library
====================================================

Introduction
------------

PedeMath is a python vector and math library.

Status - In Development
------

This is an old library that I'm in the process of updating.

Vec2 is now usable.  
Vec3 is now usable.  
Matrix44 is under development not tested heavily yet.  
   Note: matrix requires numpy (for now, but this could change).
Quat is under development not tested heavily yet.
